\section{Review Results}
\citeauthor{bertolino2019systematic} distinguish the term \textit{cloud testing} by two meanings: \textit{testing of the cloud (ToC)}, which refers to testing systems running in a cloud and \textit{testing in the cloud (TiC)} which refers to leveraging cloud technologies for testing. They find that the cloud \textit{offers the possibility to develop and maintain costly test infrastructures and to leverage on-demand scalable resources for configuration (by using cloud virtualization) and performance (by means of cloud elasticity) testing.} The literature review emerged that cloud testing in IoT usually referred to the intersection of the two. \citeauthor{bertolino2019systematic} call it \textit{testing of the cloud in the cloud (ToiC)}. It seems to be kind of natural that cloud-based test environments are set up for testing software that runs in the cloud.

\subsection{IoT cloud testing}
It was in 2019, when \citeauthor{bertolino2019systematic} concluded in their \textit{systematic review on cloud testing} that the IoT domain could certainly benefit from the cloud potential, but that it had not yet done so in large measure. They found that IoT was mentioned in many studies, but when it came to the status of IoT \textit{testing} in the cloud, numbers fell apart - at least compared with web or mobile testing. Despite of available studies and cloud testing tools and services like to CTaaS, a cloud-based TaaS (Testing as a Service) environment for example, that supports SaaS performance and scalability testing, only few of their respondents having IoT cloud products maintained a mature IoT testing environment. Half of them did not have a testing environment at all at that point \cite{bertolino2019systematic}.

In the past three years there has been progress in research as well as in industries employing IoT in regard to cloud testing. First of all, more and more cloud infrastructure is provided for IoT. Cloud computing offers expanded performance and scalability resp. elasticity. IoT devices benefit of this extraordinary deal of capacity to share information (\citeauthor{laghari2021review}). Moreover, costs for resource consumption arise by degree of usage. However \citeauthor{laghari2021review} emphasize downsides of cloud computing in terms of IoT. Especially the data ownership and communication latency represent challenges. The latter is where fog computing (also known as edge computing) comes into play. Fog IoT instead of recording, processing or analysing data centrally, namely in the cloud, reorganizes the IT structure by locating some capabilities at the edge of the network - somewhere "in the middle" between the data gathering hardware and the cloud. The minimized physical distance has a positive impact on latency reduction and the resolvement of bandwidth issues \cite{forcan2020cloud}. At the same time fog IoT can be used to ensure safety and compliance (\citeauthor{laghari2021review}) - it can contribute to the adherence to regulatory requirements e.g. in terms of restrictions towards the location of data stores. Fog IoT does not replace cloud IoT, the two complement each other.

IoT testing poses new challenges. \citeauthor{kim2018iot} sum up aptly: \textit{"The amount of IoT devices and their collaborative behavior causes new challenges to the scalability of traditional software testing, and the heterogeneity of IoT devices increases costs and the complexity of coordination of testing due to the number of variables."} They introduce how IoT Testing as a Service (IoT TaaS) \textit{"aims to resolve constraints regarding coordination, costs, and scalability issues of traditional software testing in the context of standards-based development of IoT devices"}. They design how a prospective IoT testing framework supports new requirements of IoT testing, like automatic test operation, flexible protocols, reduced costs, and better scalability and they present related work and research on various IoT test systems. Basically, they propose to rethink traditional interoperability and conformance testing approaches and semantic validation in IoT by putting the core testing logic into a so-called IoT-TaaS cloud.

\subsection{Smart grid testing}

Due to the criticality of smart grids, it is crucial to test robustness, safety and reliability of a smart grid upfront its usage in the real environment. There is the safety and performance requirement on one hand towards the software of a single device in the grid and on the other hand towards the interplay of many components - in the end the entire smart grid. \citeauthor{8449080} have developed a framework that addresses various challenges of smart grid testing. Basically they present a \textit{distributed framework for real-time management and co-simulation of demand response (DR) in smart grids}. They address especially the lack of reality, accuracy, efficiency and configurability in previous approaches and improve the evaluation of interoperability of DR algorithms with multiple smart grid control and management strategies.

Smart grids testing faces mostly the same challenges like in general does IoT testing. Smart grids represent highly heterogenous soft- and hardware landscapes. \citeauthor{smadi2021comprehensive} point out that the complex nature of smart grid structure requires the implementation of testbeds including different capabilities for extensive experimental verifications and that so far most testbeds do not provide complete hardware and software platforms to test for all research applications simultaneously. \citeauthor{smadi2021comprehensive} suggest the usage of testbeds simulating power grids where control, operation, and security algorithms can be explored, developed, evaluated, and validated. With testbeds, instead of working directly on the real physical system, a model of an actual power grid can be used.
