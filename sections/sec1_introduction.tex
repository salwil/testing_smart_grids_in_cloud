\section{Introduction}
Smart grids have gained increased interest due to being a substantial part of smart cities evolving all around the globe. Smart grids are electrical grids that replace manual by automated, i.e. digital monitoring, controlling and steering mechanisms. While smart grids open doors to unprecedented possibilities, like many technological achievements, they have some downsides. Being part of a high-risk infrastructure, they are exposed to over-average number of attacks which, if they are successful, can cause huge damage on electrical infrastructure and in the end human beings.

 deep vulnerabilities This review emphasizes scientific papers from 2018-2023 about penetration and performance testing of IoT devices, especially measuring instruments, like smart meters, can be performed in the cloud.
