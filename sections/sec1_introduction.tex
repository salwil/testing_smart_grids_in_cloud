\section{Introduction}
In context of the energy transition and by being a substantial part of smart cities, evolving all around the globe, smart grids have gained increased focus in information technology and electrical engineering communities during the last years. Smart grids are electrical grids that replace manual by automated, i.e. digital / software-based monitoring, controlling and steering mechanisms of electrical flaws and electricity consumption. While smart grids open doors to unprecedented possibilities, like many other technological achievements, they have their downsides at the same time. Being part of the highly critical infrastructure of electricity supply, they are exceptionally exposed and vulnerable towards malicious attacks. Furthermore they face high-performance requirements in order to fulfill real-time data processing. Successful cyber attacks or misbehavior due to badly performing systems can cause huge damage to institutions and humans that depend on this infrastructure.

Appropriate security and protection mechanisms and well designed software and hardware are inevitable to mitigate these risks. Such systems require a high amount of thorough testing, especially with high focus to their vulnerabilities. Penetration and performance testing can be key to addressing the two main weaknesses of smart grids and cloud testing can make extended testing feasible by providing highly scalable test environments and resources.

This present review study emphasizes scientific papers containing research about penetration and performance testing of IoT devices - especially software for smart meters -, communication networks and data management systems, in the cloud.
