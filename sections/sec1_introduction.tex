\section{Introduction}
Being a substantial part of smart cities, evolving all around the globe, smart grids have gained increased focus from the society during the last years. Smart grids are electrical grids that replace manual by automated, i.e. digital / software-based monitoring, controlling and steering mechanisms of electrical flaws and electricity consumption. While smart grids open doors to unprecedented possibilities, like many other technological achievements, they have some downsides at the same time. Being part of the highly critical infrastructure of electricity supply, they are exceptionally exposed and vulnerable towards malicious attacks. Furthermore they face high-performance requirements in order to fulfill real-time data processing. Successful cyber attacks or misbehavior due to badly performing systems can cause huge damage to institutions and humans depending on this infrastructure.

Appropriate security and protection mechanisms and well designed software and hardware are inevitable to minimize these risks. Such systems require a high amount of thorough testing, especially with high focus to their vulnerabilities. Penetration and performance testing can be key to addressing the two main weaknesses of smart grids and cloud testing can make extended testing feasible by providing highly scalable test environments and resources.

This present review study emphasizes scientific papers from the years 2018 - 2023 containing research about penetration and performance testing of IoT devices, especially software for smart meters, communication networks and data management systems, in the cloud.

The search included manual document retrieval from four popular web libraries: IEEE, Google Scholar, Xplore and ACM Digital Library. From initially XX potential papers, XX were selected based on suitability criteria for the topic. Backward snowballing iterations have been done on the six most relevant papers, which added another XX papers to the review. The documents have been retrieved by using the following search terms in different combinations: smart grid, cloud testing, cloud computing, IoT, penetration testing, performance testing, testbed, co-simulation.
