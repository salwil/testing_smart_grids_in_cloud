\section{Related Work}
So far no literature review covering cloud testing techniques in smart grid industry have been found. However research has been done on the topic itself. Quite extensive research about how to test IoT in general with regard to cyber security, performance and interoperability has been done, as well as proposals on how cloud computing could support the implementation of extensive test environments is available. There is also literature about challenges of testing smart grids and how they might be solved. The focus lies mainly on the verification of smart grids' cyber and physical security and the interoperatiblity of the systems components.
