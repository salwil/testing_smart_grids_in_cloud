\section{Related Work}
So far no literature review covering cloud testing techniques for IoT devices in smart grid industry have been found. However research has been done on the topic itself. Research about how to test IoT devices generally with regard to cyber security and performance aspects has been done, as well as proposals on how such tests could be executed on the cloud. Furthermore there is a bunch of literature about how software components of smart grids can be tested and which frameworks and tools are available. Finally there are also some papers, investigating how cloud-based testing might help improving smart grids' resistance to the mentioned risks / vulnerabilities.
