\begin{abstract}
The present document contains a review on the topic of common testing techniques that are applied in the domain of smart grid testing and what role cloud testing plays. Intelligent electrical supply systems are subject to an emerging field of research, especially the related risks of cyber security attacks, the challenges of processing high data volumes in real-time and sustaining flawless interoperability within complex systems. The need of comprehensively testing such systems is obvious. This review collects and elaborates core statements on the current state of research about cloud-based testing IoT, particularly smart grid infrastructure, like communication networks or control systems.
