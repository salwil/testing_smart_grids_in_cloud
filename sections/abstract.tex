The present document contains a review on the topic of cloud testing approaches that have been applied in the domain of smart grid testing so far. Intelligent electrical supply systems are subject to an emerging field of research, especially the related risks of cyber security attacks and the challenge of processing high data volumes in real-time. The review emphasizes scientific papers from 2018 - 2023 about penetration and performance testing of cloud-based IoT devices, like smart meters, and metering infrastructure, like communication networks or data management systems.
